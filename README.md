# Playground Bachelor Thesis
This repository contains experiments for my bachelor thesis about the _Lottery Ticket Hypothesis_.
Currently implemented experiments:
- Finding winning tickets from fully-connected Lenet 300-100 on MNIST using Iterative Magnitude Pruning
- Finding winning tickets from convolutional Conv-2 on CIFAR-10 using Iterative Magnitude Pruning
- Finding winning tickets from convolutional Conv-4 on CIFAR-10 using Iterative Magnitude Pruning
- Finding winning tickets from convolutional Conv-6 on CIFAR-10 using Iterative Magnitude Pruning
